### Week 3: Introduction to Node.js
- **Topics to Learn**:
  - [ ] Node.js basics, event loop, global objects
  - [ ] Working with the Node.js REPL and modules (CommonJS and ES6 modules)
  - [ ] Introduction to npm and package management
- **Practice**:
  - [ ] Build a simple "Hello World" server with Node.js
  - [ ] Install and use a package from npm (e.g., `lodash` or `axios`)

### Week 4: File System and Basic HTTP Server
- **Topics to Learn**:
  - [ ] Working with the Node.js File System (fs) module
  - [ ] Creating a basic HTTP server
  - [ ] Handling HTTP requests and responses

  - [ ] Set up route handlers for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

### Week 6: Building RESTful APIs
- **Topics to Learn**:
  - [ ] RESTful API design principles
  - [ ] Query parameters, route parameters, and request validation
  - [ ] Using middleware for authentication and logging
- **Practice**:
  - [ ] Add authentication (JWT or session-based) to your API
  - [ ] Implement error handling and validation for API requests

### Week 7: Working with Databases (MongoDB)
- **Topics to Learn**:

  - [ ] Creating models and schemas
  - [ ] CRUD operations with MongoDB
- **Practice**:
  - [ ] Connect your API to a MongoDB database
  - [ ] Implement CRUD endpoints using Mongoose for a sample resource (e.g., users, products)

### Week 8: Authentication and Authorization
- **Topics to Learn**:
  - [ ] JWT-based authentication
  - [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - [ ] Password hashing and security best practices
- **Practice**:
  - [ ] Implement user registration and login with hashed passwords
  - [ ] Add role-based authorization to restrict access to certain routes

  - [ ] Aggregation and advanced querying in MongoDB
  - [ ] File uploads with Multer
- **Practice**:
  - [ ] Add pagination, sorting, and filtering to an API endpoint
  - [ ] Implement a file upload route using Multer for image uploads

### Week 10: Testing with Jest and Supertest
- **Topics to Learn**:
  - [ ] Unit testing and integration testing
  - [ ] Setting up Jest and Supertest
  - [ ] Testing asynchronous code and API endpoints
- **Practice**:

  - [ ] Write integration tests for API routes

### Week 11: Performance Optimization and Caching
- **Topics to Learn**:
  - [ ] Improving performance with caching (e.g., Redis)
  - [ ] Rate limiting and security middleware
  - [ ] Profiling and monitoring tools (e.g., PM2, New Relic)
- **Practice**:
  - [ ] Set up Redis for caching frequently accessed data
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting and security middleware for sensitive routes

### Week 12: Deploying and Scaling
- **Topics to Learn**:
  - [ ] Deployment basics with Docker
  - [ ] CI/CD pipelines for Node.js apps
  - [ ] Scaling Node.js applications
- **Practice**:
  - [ ] Dockerize your Node.js application
  - [ ] Deploy to a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean) or use a platform like Heroku or Vercel
